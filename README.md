# digit_Recognition

This project explores the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for handwritten digit recognition. CNNs have emerged as a powerful tool in image classification tasks due to their ability to learn features hierarchically and extract patterns from raw data. In this study, we trained a CNN on the MNIST dataset, which contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits. Our model achieved a high accuracy rate of over 99%, demonstrating the effectiveness of CNNs in this task. We also explored techniques such as data augmentation to improve the modelâ€™s generalization ability. Overall, this project provides insights into the design and optimization of CNNs for handwritten digit recognition.
